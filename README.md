# Agentic Operator

Event-driven multi-agent runtime and operations console. The portal, REST API,
Inngest workers, SQLite system of record, append-only run logs, model gateway,
MCP/tool integrations, and observability views run as one workspace.

## Runtime contract

- Every run uses the configured real model provider; there is no demo mode and
  no synthetic-model substitute.
- Non-test API processes fail closed when the provider/model is mock-like or a
  required credential is missing.
- External systems are called only through configured tools or MCP servers.
  Missing credentials produce an explicit integration gap; the runtime does not
  invent upstream records or silently report success.
- Deterministic adapters, fixtures, and replay stubs are restricted to tests and
  explicit sandbox verification. They are never listed as production providers.
- SQLite, NDJSON/run-log files, SSE, and the observability APIs are fed by the
  same persisted execution records. The UI does not maintain a second sample
  dataset.

Workflows and agents can also be authored from the portal: Agent Studio edits
per-agent V2 definitions, the workflow-authoring API drafts/validates/publishes
manifests, Settings → Tokens mints tenant API tokens, and Settings →
Integrations stores third-party credentials (e.g. GoHire) encrypted per tenant.
LLM traffic is routed per tenant through the gateway (providers include
Moonshot and Z.ai) and accounted in a usage ledger surfaced at `/v1/usage`.

The workspace requires exactly Node 26.8.1 and pnpm 11.21.0. Both versions are
pinned and enforced by the root lifecycle guards.

## Local development

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
# Configure a unique AUTH_SESSION_SECRET, a real LLM provider/model and its
# credentials, plus explicit AGENTIC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL, _NAME and _PASSWORD
# values for the one-time seed. The repository contains no default account.
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` starts one supervised stack and terminates stale processes from this
workspace before binding ports. The API must accept HTTP before the web and
Inngest processes start, so portal session checks cannot race API startup. The
supervisor tolerates brief API reloads and stops the stack after a sustained
outage. `pnpm dev:e2e` uses the same ordering with API watching disabled:

- portal: <http://localhost:3599>
- API/health: <http://localhost:3540/health>
- Inngest dev server: <http://localhost:8488>

Use `pnpm dev:restart` for a clean restart. Use `bash scripts/stop-dev.sh` to
stop only processes owned by this workspace.

The API loads `.env` first and `apps/api/.env.local` second. Never commit either
file. `.env.example` contains no usable upstream key or fake integration URL.

## Health and verification

```bash
curl --fail http://localhost:3540/health
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
./scripts/build.sh
pnpm codex:runtime:install
pnpm codex:protocol:check
pnpm verify:codex-harness
pnpm --filter @agentic/api verify:observability
```

`./scripts/build.sh` selects Node from `.nvmrc` (via nvm when needed), uses the pinned
pnpm version, and runs the production build with the native-module guard.
Use `./scripts/build.sh --install` to install dependencies from the frozen lockfile
first; a missing `node_modules` triggers that automatically. Additional flags
go to Turbo, for example `./scripts/build.sh --force` for an uncached build.

An immutable OntoPlanet package is admitted through a separate, non-runtime
boundary. The command below validates the vendored OntoPlanet 3.2.0 envelope
and all six family schemas, then verifies family/package hashes,
workflow/subflow pins and candidate Agent restrictions. Persistent output
requires all three exact trust pins. It emits an explicitly non-deployable
shadow receipt and, optionally, a closed-world non-deployable runtime plan. It
refuses the source package, aliased outputs and runtime `models/` roots, and
never imports a manifest or registers a workflow:

```bash
pnpm ontology-package:inspect -- \
  --package /path/to/package.json \
  --expected-id <package-id> \
  --expected-release <release> \
  --expected-hash sha256:<digest> \
  --out artifacts/ontology/<domain>/<release>/shadow-candidate.json \
  --runtime-plan-out artifacts/ontology/<domain>/<release>/runtime-plan-candidate.json
```

See [the Ontology Package handoff contract](docs/power-purchase-ontology-package-handoff.md)
for the current runtime boundary.

`/health` reports the database, event broker, storage/fanout backends, selected
model provider/model and whether the gateway is mock-backed. A production-ready
local response must have `ok: true` and `llmGateway.mock: false`.

`verify:codex-harness` checks the exact Codex version and performs the required
app-server handshake using an isolated temporary `CODEX_HOME`. It does not make
a model call or inherit provider credentials. See
[`docs/design/codex-harness.md`](docs/design/codex-harness.md) for the runtime
boundary and upgrade procedure.

`verify:observability` is an isolated canary labelled as a test run. It uses
the configured real default provider/model (and refuses mock), then verifies
persistence, run logs, SSE replay, `llm_calls`, token accounting and agent-call
aggregation without claiming that an external business action occurred.

The Logs page exposes:

- operation, event and run logs;
- a live SSE terminal with persisted history backfill and reconnect;
- token usage by model, provider, agent and run;
- agent-to-agent/tool call traces;
- time-series, failure, latency and cost statistics.

## Authentication

The checked-in example defaults to `AUTH_MODE=production`, which requires real
authenticated sessions/tokens and a unique `AUTH_SESSION_SECRET` even during
local development. `AUTH_MODE=dev` is an explicit sandbox-only bypass: it also
requires `AGENTIC_DEV_TENANT`, selects a real active database user, and is
rejected whenever `NODE_ENV=production`. Tenant identity always comes from the
authenticated principal and verified memberships.

`pnpm db:seed` provisions the deployable tenant rows and exactly one bootstrap
superadmin from `AGENTIC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL`,
`AGENTIC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_NAME`, and `AGENTIC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. All
three are mandatory. Create additional administrators/operators/viewers through
the authenticated Access surface; seed never installs sample identities.

## Adding a tenant

1. Add a versioned manifest directory under `models/<tenant>-v1/` containing the
   workflow and domain ontology JSON files.
2. Add or update the tenant row through the supported tenant API/seed path.
3. If custom runtime code is required, add `tenants/<tenant>/`, declare the
   workspace dependency in `apps/api/package.json`, and register it in
   `apps/api/src/bootstrap.ts`.
4. Configure every external tool credential and validate it from Settings.
5. Restart the API and verify registration through `/health`, Agents,
   Workflows, Events and a real run trace.

Manifest-only tenants do not need a TypeScript package when global tools cover
their integrations. A missing ontology, tool binding or credential is a build or
runtime error, not a reason to synthesize data.

## Container preview

```bash
cp .env.production.example .env.production
# Fill every required secret/provider value.
docker compose --env-file .env.production up --build
```

The container network uses API port 3501 and Inngest port 8288; these differ
from the local `pnpm dev` ports so both stacks can coexist. Compose persists the
database, logs and artifacts in named volumes.

The release workflow publishes lower-case image names to the current GitHub
repository owner's GHCR namespace. It contains no placeholder registry.

## Data and safety

- Runtime state lives under `data/`; model manifests live under `models/`.
- `pnpm db:wipe-runtime` removes runtime traffic while preserving identity and
  configuration. Treat it as destructive.
- Run cancellation is exposed through `POST /v1/runs/:id/cancel` and is
  idempotent.
- Inbound provider webhooks require configured HMAC secrets.
- External write tools must advertise side effects and pass runtime policy and
  credential gates before dispatch.
- Do not treat generated sandbox manifests or historical test runs as evidence
  of a live upstream integration; use the run's test/provenance fields and live
  provider/tool trace.

Production variables and their validation rules are documented in
`.env.production.example`. Operational procedures live in `docs/RUNBOOK.md`.
