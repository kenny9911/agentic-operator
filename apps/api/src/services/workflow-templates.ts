 * with no headings at all therefore scores `weak: []` and trips only

 *     logic action (step-engine.ts:2183) and `parseStructuredJson` requires
 *     valid JSON, so free prose is impossible; an object root is what every
 *     provider's JSON mode handles natively. A bare string root would make the
 *     model emit a naked quoted JSON literal — fragile across providers.
 *   - `user_prompt_template` is omitted. `compileAgentPrompts` puts the prompt
 *     port value first and then appends the rendered template inside
 *     `<agent-inputs>` (agent-execution.ts:411-414), so seeding
 *     `{{inputs.prompt}}` would send the operator's message twice.
 *
 * Names derive from the workflow slug because the Inngest function id is
 * `${tenantSlug}.${agentName}` (packages/runtime/src/event-name.ts) and nothing
 * validates agent-name uniqueness across a tenant — a fixed `starterAgent`
 * would collide on the second blank workflow in the same Business Domain.
