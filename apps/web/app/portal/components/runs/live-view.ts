/**
 * Pure logic for the Runs page's live workflow view.
 *
 * The Workflows page is the workflow's BUILD TIME surface — the canvas you
 * design on. This view is its RUNTIME counterpart: the same node/edge graph,
 * but read-only and coloured by what is happening right now, with an activity
 * feed beside it. Everything here is a pure function so vitest can drive it
 * with a scripted event sequence — no EventSource, no react-query.
 *
 * Node state comes from `useWorkflowLiveState` (already keyed by manifest agent
 * name). This module adds what that hook does not: the feed projection, and the
 * node → visual-treatment mapping.
 *
 * The feed's job is to show what an agent is actually DOING, not merely that it
 * is busy — the steps it walks, the tools it dispatches, the model calls it
 * makes, the log lines it writes. Every field name below comes from
 * `RunStreamEvent` in @agentic/contracts; read that before adding a variant,
 * because a wrong key here fails silently, as a row that simply never appears.

 * the same canvas renders it with no second code path to keep in step.
