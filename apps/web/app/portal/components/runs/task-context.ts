/**
 * Turning a run's payload into something a person can decide on.
 *
 * A generated manual step asks for the identifiers the downstream ERP write
 * needs — alert_id, chain_id, option_id, option_type. Nobody can type those
 * from memory, and nothing was filling them in, so the form was unanswerable
 * even though every value was sitting in the run's own payload one step
 * upstream. Worse, the panel showed no business context at all: an approver
 * was asked to approve or reject with no idea which stage slipped, by how long,
 * or why.
 *
 * Both are fixed from the same source — the task's `preparedContext` (what the
 * earlier manual steps decided) and the run's trigger payload (what the agents
 * found). This module reads those, and is deliberately tenant-agnostic: it
 * matches on the shape of the data and on the form's own field names, never on
 * business field names, so it works the same for any compiled ontology.
