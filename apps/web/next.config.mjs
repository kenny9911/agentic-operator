 * Next 16 ships Turbopack as default for dev. The web workspace has no

 * is safe here. The api still runs on Node 26 + better-sqlite3 12 directly.
 *
 * Web is UI-only. All data calls go through /v1/* which Next rewrites to
 * apps/api on :3540. Same-origin in dev; in prod a reverse proxy serves the
 * same paths.
 *
 * Routing decisions:
 *   - `/v1/*`, `/health`            → proxied to apps/api on :3540.
 *   - everything else               → Next.js App Router. `/portal/*` is the
 *                                     real production UI (TypeScript +
 *                                     react-query); `/` redirects there via
 *                                     `apps/web/app/page.tsx`.
